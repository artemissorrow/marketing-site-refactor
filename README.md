# Marketing Site Refactor

**Examined given HTML for accessibility and a logical structure and edited the code to solve the following issues:**
- Added a clear, descriptive title
- Cleared up 'div soup' and used semantic tags where possible (and where it made sense to do so)
- Added alt tags with image descriptions to all images (tried to follow recommendations from [Perkins School for the Blind](https://www.perkinselearning.org/technology/blog/how-write-alt-text-and-image-descriptions-visually-impaired) for writing image descriptions)
- Remedied a typo that was causing one of the navigation links to not function
- Streamlined class attributes wherever possible, which is a nice lead-in to...

**Examined given CSS for clarity and conciseness, as well as functionality for matching the given site mock-up. Made the following edits:**
- Condensed down redundant CSS styling the sections in the main and sidebar sections of the page using the edited classes mentioned above
- Reorganized rules so that various sections of the site are grouped together
- Added comments with color scheme and table of contents for easy future reference
- Edited header menu to match mock-up
- Edited selectors to match the semantic tags in newly-edited HTML
